# 1. Objective

###### Objective
>The digital phantoms described and distributed below can be incorporated in simulation software, such as [GATE](http://www.opengatecollaboration.org) for emulating nuclear medicine acquisition. We provide a Defrise, Derenzo, and Jaszczak phantoms used in quality control procedures. Additionaly, we provide digital phantoms emulating clinical brain perfusion, dopamine transporter, and glioblastoma radiotracer distribution. 

The open-source **mesh50_XCAT** phantom based on the 4D extended cardiac-torso digital anthropomorphic ([XCAT](https://otc.duke.edu/industry-investors/available-technologies/xcat/)) human phantom can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/BenAuer2021/Mesh-based-Human-Phantom-for-Simulation/edit/main/README.md).

# 2. Defrise Phantom

## 2.1 Description

We provide the Defrise attenuation and activity voxelized phantoms in interfile format (*16-bit unsigned integer, \*.i33 for raw data and \*.h33 for the header files*). The 20-cm diameter cylindrical Defrise phantom can be used to estimate axial sampling of nuclear medicine imaging systems. It is based on the [Defrise Insert<sup>TM</sup> Model ECT/DEF/I](https://www.spect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Micro-Defrise-Phantom.pdf) from Data Spectrum Corporation, Durham, NC, USA.

</p>

The 20-cm long Defrise phantom consists of a series of 13 hot disks (20-cm diameter, 8 mm in length) evenly spaced 8 mm apart along the axial direction. The Defrise activity phantom (**Defrise_200x200x200.i33**) can be simulated as being filled with uniform tracer activity throughout the volume of the hot disks. The integer values for the hot and cold disk are set to 10 and 0, respectively. It consists of 200x200x200 voxels 1 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 16 MB).
  
The voxelized attenuation phantom (**Defrise_Atn_200x200x200.i33**) can be used in attenuation correction for SPECT or PET reconstruction and/or as attenuation media for simulation. The integer values for the hot and cold disk are set to 1 and 0, respectively. Similarly to the activity phantom, it consists of 200x200x200 voxels 1 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 16 MB).
