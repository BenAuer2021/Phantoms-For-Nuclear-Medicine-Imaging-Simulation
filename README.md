# 1. Objective

###### Objective
>The digital phantoms described and distributed below can be incorporated in simulation software, such as [GATE](http://www.opengatecollaboration.org) for emulating nuclear medicine acquisition. We provide a Defrise, Derenzo, and Jaszczak phantoms used in quality control procedures. Additionaly, we provide digital phantoms emulating clinical brain perfusion, dopamine transporter, and glioblastoma radiotracer distribution. 

The open-source **mesh50_XCAT** phantom based on the 4D extended cardiac-torso digital anthropomorphic ([XCAT](https://otc.duke.edu/industry-investors/available-technologies/xcat/)) human phantom can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/BenAuer2021/Mesh-based-Human-Phantom-for-Simulation/edit/main/README.md).

# 2. Description

## 2.1 STL-based phantoms (**mesh50_XCAT**)

We provide 3 versions of the **mesh50_XCAT** phantom with different lengths (**Whole Body**, **Head-Torso-Abdominal Only**, and **Head Only**) as showed on the figure below.
